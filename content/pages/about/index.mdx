## About 

The Autonomous Golf Cart Project at Vanderbilt University is a student-led initiative at the Emerging Tech Lab located in the Wondry. 

Our goal is to create a rich environment for students passionate about learning new technologies for autonomous vehicles and developing Vanderbilt's first recreational, passenger-size, self-driving golf cart. 

This project is generously funded by the Wondry and IBM.
